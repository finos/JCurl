# Contributing to JCurl
Thanks for your interest in the project! Here is some basic information about how to contribute.
 
# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
All contributions to [Symphony Software Foundation](https://symphony.foundation/) projects must be made under a [Contributor License Agreement](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FM/Legal+Requirements#LegalRequirements-ContributorLicenseAgreement) that authorizes the Foundation to distribute your code under the Apache License. Contributions must also meet the Foundation's [license and notice requirements](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FM/Legal+Requirements) that must also be met.
 
Pull requests (PRs) submitted to the project cannot be accepted until you have a CLA in place with the Foundation.
 
# Contributing Issues
 
## Prerequisites
 
* [ ] Have you searched for duplicate issues?  A simple search for exception error messages or a summary of the unexpected behavior should suffice.
* [ ] Are you running the latest release of the project?
 
## Raising an Issue
* Create your issue in the project issue tracker.
* New issues contain two templates in the description: bug report and enhancement request. Please pick the most appropriate for your issue, and delete the other.
  * Please also tag the new issue with either "Bug" or "Enhancement".
* Please use [Markdown formatting](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)
liberally to assist in readability.
  * [Code fences](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for exception stack traces and log entries, for example, massively improve readability.
 
# Contributing Pull Requests (Code & Docs)
To make review of PRs easier, please:
 
 * Please make sure your PRs will merge cleanly - PRs that don't are unlikely to be accepted.
 * For code contributions, follow the general structure of the existing code.
 * For documentation contributions, follow the general structure, language, and tone of the existing docs.
 * Keep PRs small and cohesive - if you have multiple contributions, please submit them as independent PRs.
 * Reference issue #s if your PR has anything to do with an issue (even if it doesn't address it).
 * Minimize non-functional changes (e.g. whitespace shenanigans).
 * Ensure all new files include a header comment block containing the [Apache License v2.0 and your copyright information](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#apply).
 * If necessary (e.g. due to 3rd party dependency licensing requirements), update the NOTICE file with any required attribution or other notices
 * If your contribution includes source code for any Category B-licensed dependencies, add an appropriate notice to this CONTRIBUTING file
